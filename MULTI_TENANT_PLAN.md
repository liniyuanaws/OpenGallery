# Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation Plan

## Overview
This branch implements comprehensive multi-tenant isolation for the Jaaz application to ensure user data privacy and security.

## Current Issues Identified
1. **No User Authentication**: API endpoints lack authentication middleware
2. **Database Schema**: Missing user_id fields in all tables
3. **Data Isolation**: All users see the same canvas projects and sessions
4. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Messages broadcast to all connected users
5. **Agent Context**: No user context in Strands agent instances

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- Add `user_id` field to:
  - `canvases` table
  - `chat_sessions` table  
  - `chat_messages` table
  - `files` table
- Create user-specific indexes for efficient querying
- Implement database migration scripts

### 2. Authentication Middleware
- Create FastAPI middleware to extract JWT tokens
- Validate user authentication on each request
- Add user context to request state
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

### 3. API Endpoint Security
- Add authentication decorators to all endpoints
- Filter data by user_id in database queries
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Update canvas and session CRUD operations

### 4. WebSocket User Isolation
- Implement user-specific WebSocket rooms
- Filter session updates by user ownership
- Prevent cross-user message broadcasting
- Add user authentication to WebSocket connections

### 5. Agent Context Enhancement
- Add user_id to Strands context manager
- Update agent tools to respect user boundaries
- Ensure file operations are user-scoped
- Add user context to image generation tools

### 6. Frontend Authentication Integration
- Include JWT tokens in API requests
- Update authentication context handling
- Handle user-specific data in components
- Implement proper error handling for auth failures

### 7. Testing and Validation
- Create unit tests for user isolation
- Test cross-user data access prevention
- Validate WebSocket message filtering
- Performance testing with multiple users

## Security Considerations
- Prevent horizontal privilege escalation
- Ensure proper data sanitization
- Implement rate limiting per user
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## Migration Strategy
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Data migration scripts for existing data
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Success Criteria
- Users can only see their own canvas projects
- Sessions are isolated per user
- WebSocket messages are user-specific
- Agent operations respect user boundaries
- No data leakage between users
